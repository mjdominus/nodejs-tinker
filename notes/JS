* Using objects as hashes in JS is a pain in the ass. There is no
  keys() function.

* Using arrays in JS is a pain in the ass.  for..in works only for
  hashes.  You could however use for (var i in array) { ..array[i].. }
  I think.

* Whether to use .method() versus .attribute is going to be a
  perennial problem.
