Architecture plan:

Store comments in memecached indexed by "comment:" + ID number.  Also
store "maxid" in memcached.  Use memcached atomic increment to
allocate new IDS.

API server accepts only the following call:
*  Post comment: input, comment data; output is new comment ID or failure code.
   Stores comment in memcached. Also caches dates of known comments.


* API server
  * Set up with node
  * Parse request
  * Allocate ID for new comment
  * Store comment in memcached
  * Return success / failure code

* Ajax page
   * Memcached communication
   * Periodically check "maxid"
   * if maxid has increased, query memcached for new comments
   * insert new comments into page
   * When form posted, communicate new comment to API server
   * On success, insert new comment into page

* Memcached
   * Sysadmin work
